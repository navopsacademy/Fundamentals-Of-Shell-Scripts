## 📌 About

Shell scripting allows you to automate repetitive tasks and sequence commands in the Linux/Unix shell environment. These scripts demonstrate basic constructs like **echo**, **variables**, **user input**, **conditionals**, **loops**, and more. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before using these scripts:

* Linux/Unix environment (Linux, WSL, macOS Terminal, etc.)
* Basic shell experience (i.e., using `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc.)
* Bash installed (default on most systems) ([TutorialsPoint][2])

---

## 🚀 Usage
